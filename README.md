# IfNeitherAddOne-PowerShell
Simple Powershell script so that if a user is not in either of the groups we're searching add them to one of them.

# This was initially setup to add all users who aren't in an MFA group or Non-MFA group added to the Non-MFA group.



```
###Add users not in either group to the first Group###

#Set Variables being used in our sections that determine and set local group membership

$Group1 = Get-ADGroupMember -Identity "CHANGE TO GROUP 1" -Recursive | Select-Object -ExpandProperty SamAccountName
$Group2 = Get-ADGroupMember -Identity "CHANGE TO GROUP 1" -Recursive | Select-Object -ExpandProperty SamAccountName

Get-ADUser -Filter * |
ForEach {
        $_.SamAccountName
        If (-not($Group1 -contains $_.SamAccountName -or $Group2 -contains $_.SamAccountName)){
        Add-ADGroupMember -Identity 'CHANGE TO DESTINATION GROUP' -Members $_.SamAccountName 
    }
}
```
